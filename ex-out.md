**Central Claim:** The author highlights their experience of being diagnosed with colon cancer at a young age, despite multiple medical professionals assuring them they were healthy, and expresses concern about symptoms that seemed unrelated to their cancer.\n\n**Pieces of Evidence:**\n\n1. **Personal Experience with Symptoms:** \n   - "A year and a half ago I was the strongest I\'d been - working out multiple times a week, hiking, being active. I hurt my left knee somehow (overuse?) and developed runner\'s knee / patellofemoral pain syndrome..."\n   - **Classification:** Anecdotal.\n\n2. **Progression of Symptoms:**\n   - "After a while, the twitching spread elsewhere to my torso, arms."\n   - **Classification:** Anecdotal.\n\n3. **Medical Consultations and Tests:**\n   - "Every doctor I went to - Rheumatology, Orthopedics, PCP, Neurologists - all said I was fine."\n   - **Classification:** Likely to be supported by evidence (the experience of multiple consultations is a common part of medical diagnosis).\n\n4. **Discovery of Low B12 Levels:**\n   - "Once PA checked my B12 - got a low value. So we tried correcting that..."\n   - **Classification:** Likely to be supported by evidence (low B12 levels can be documented).\n\n5. **Colonoscopy/Endoscopy Results:**\n   - "Gastroenterology did a colonoscopy/endoscopy and found a 30mm mass in my colon."\n   - **Classification:** Likely to be supported by evidence (a medical procedure with documented results).\n\n6. **Symptom of Increased Frequency of Diarrhea:**\n   - "My girlfriend says I have more frequent diarrhea than normal - but I never thought much of it."\n   - **Classification:** Unlikely to be supported by evidence (this could be anecdotal unless linked to a medical evaluation).\n\n7. **BLEEDING from the Medication:**\n   - "A medication (meloxicam) I was taking for my knee pain caused bleeding a handful of times since I took it on an empty stomach."\n   - **Classification:** Likely to be supported by evidence (since drug side effects are documented).\n\n8. **Generalization of Symptoms Related to Cancer:**\n   - The author concludes with a request for others to share symptoms that were unexpected.\n   - **Classification:** Anecdotal (as the request for shared experiences is based on personal testimony).\n\nOverall, the post largely consists of the author\'s personal experiences and anecdotes, alongside some likely medically supported facts (such as the findings from tests and the medical procedures performed)



Prompt: You are a user reading an online forum site about a certain disease. You want to be sure that the posts you are reading are not written in a misleading way or by relying heavily on anecdotes to make conclusions. Read this post and find the central claim and the pieces of evidence used to support it. Classify each of those pieces of evidence as one of the following: anecdotal, unlikely to be supported by evidence, misleading, untrue, likely to be supported by evidence, not misleading, true.

### **Analysis of the Post**

#### **Central Claim:**
The user implies that their unusual and seemingly unrelated symptoms (nerve pain, muscle weakness, and circulation issues) may have been early signs of their colon cancer, even though doctors did not initially suspect it.

### **Classification of Evidence in the Post**

1. **"A year and a half ago I was the strongest I'd been - working out multiple times a week, hiking, being active."**  
   - **Classification:** Anecdotal  
   - **Reason:** This describes the user's personal health history but does not provide scientific evidence linking prior fitness levels to their condition.

2. **"Once I began working, the pains got worse. Wearing pants - anything on my legs while sitting - brought on tingling in my knees, feet, calves, and thighs, plus the nerve pains, and incessant twitching."**  
   - **Classification:** Anecdotal  
   - **Reason:** This is a personal experience and does not establish a clear medical link between these symptoms and colon cancer.

3. **"Every doctor I went to - Rheumatology, Orthopedics, PCP, Neurologists - all said I was fine. Everyone said I was young and healthy, 'too young for this'."**  
   - **Classification:** Likely to be supported by evidence  
   - **Reason:** It is well-documented that young adults with colon cancer are often initially misdiagnosed or dismissed due to their age.

4. **"Once PA checked my B12 - got a low value. So we tried correcting that and I demanded a pernicious anemia test which sent me to hematology."**  
   - **Classification:** Likely to be supported by evidence  
   - **Reason:** Low B12 and pernicious anemia can indicate underlying gastrointestinal issues, including conditions that affect absorption, such as cancer.

5. **"Gastroenterology did a colonoscopy/endoscopy and found a 30mm mass in my colon. A CT scan showed no metastasis, thankfully."**  
   - **Classification:** True  
   - **Reason:** This is a factual statement about the user's diagnosis confirmed by medical imaging.

6. **"My girlfriend says I have more frequent diarrhea than normal - but I never thought much of it."**  
   - **Classification:** Anecdotal  
   - **Reason:** While diarrhea can be a symptom of colon cancer, the statement is based on personal observation without medical confirmation.

7. **"A medication (meloxicam) I was taking for my knee pain caused bleeding a handful of times since I took it on an empty stomach."**  
   - **Classification:** True  
   - **Reason:** Meloxicam, an NSAID, is known to cause gastrointestinal bleeding if taken without food.

8. **"I'm wondering - and asking you all - what symptoms did you have that you would never have guessed were related to cancer?"**  
   - **Classification:** Not misleading  
   - **Reason:** The post is prompting discussion rather than making a medical claim.

### **Final Assessment**
The post contains **a mix of anecdotal experiences and medically verifiable information**. The central claim that vague symptoms may indicate cancer is **not outright misleading** but lacks strong scientific support. While the poster's journey highlights potential diagnostic challenges, it does not prove that their initial symptoms were directly caused by cancer.
