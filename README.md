# verify.ai

Verify.ai is a chrome extension designed to help users avoid medical misinformation. It is currently adapted for reddit posts about medical experiences or ideas which may be untrue or based in anecdotal evidence. More informed patients will help create a better patient-doctor relationship and help those suffering from illness recieve a more accurate diagnosis faster. This could also be extended to a patient portal, where you can verify messages your medical provider has sent you.

Verify.ai automatically scrapes the content of a reddit post, but has a manual text entry feature for assessing comments on that post or other medical-related text.

# Install

clone the repository and go to chrome://extensions, toggle 'developer mode' to on, press 'load unpacked' and select the folder for this project.
